I thought I'd share a final course project I did on "The Rise of the Career Politician." The website can be found [here](https://6859-sp21.github.io/final-project-the-rise-of-the-career-politician/). 

The website is not the best; I am a poor web developer and I missed the boat on the whole "scale the website to the size of the screen" thing. But the visualizations and findings are somewhat interesting.
