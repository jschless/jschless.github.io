          <p>I’m starting a blog, and there are many reasons to scratch your head. What does a 20-something-year-old have to say? Who cares? Who will read it? And on and on. This is more than some millenial rite-of-passage, but not by much. Here are my reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I’m bored. This seems like a productive way to occupy my time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a few things to share. I have no audience, but I always have my mom. This is a digital variant of the kitchen refrigerator, and my posts are a slightly more advanced crayon drawing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I anticipate having more things to share. I write this at the onset of my Master’s Program, where I’ll be studying both technology policy and some applied math / econ. I will be writing a lot, and can use this site to share and catalog my work. This will likely include op-eds, policy recommendations/analyses, and mathy/codey things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having this burden will motivate me to write, which is something I enjoy and need to practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can share my books I’ve read and what I’ve learned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a working resume.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So let it be known, before I’m swallowed by my own ego, that this quest had humble beginnings.</p>
