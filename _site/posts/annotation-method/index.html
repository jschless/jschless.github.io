          <p>What’s the last book you read? What were the main points? You probably don’t remember as much as you would like.</p>

<p>It’s a reader’s paradox: we enjoy books, we spend several hours reading them, we feel like we’re learning from them, yet a few weeks later we can’t remember their basic details. This topic was covered in this week’s <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/andy-matuschak-on-books-and-learning/">EconTalk</a>. I thought I’d share the solution I came up with awhile back.</p>

<p>I was frustrated with not remembering things, especially after sinking hours into a book. So, I started annotating. I would underline, write comments, etc. This didn’t work that well because I rarely revisited the books. I had the option to flip through the book and read the notes I made in the margins, but it wasn’t convenient.</p>

<p>Then I saw this post from Ryan Holiday on keeping a <a href="https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/">commonplace book</a>. A commonplace book is simply a collection of thoughts, quotes, knowledge, etc. Anything that is interesting and may be useful later goes in it.</p>

<p>Ryan Holiday uses a collection of index cards organized into boxes, which is quaint and seduces my luddite soul, but is incompatible with my toddler’s handwriting. I use <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a>, which is a phenomenal note-taking tool. With Evernote, I can read, edit, and search my notes from any device. It’s also free (for most purposes).</p>

<p>My technique is pretty simple. I think it successfully limits interruption to reading, which was my goal.</p>

<h2 id="annotation-method">Annotation Method</h2>

<ol>
  <li>When you read, try to read with a pen.</li>
  <li>When you read something that interests you or is worth saving for later, bracket the quote with your pen and jot down a note, if you want.</li>
  <li>Fold the corner of the bottom of the page in towards the annotation.</li>
  <li>Continue reading.</li>
  <li>When you finish the book, catalog your annotations in your commonplace book.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s pretty quick; All you do is re-read the section that you originally found interesting, which you should be happy to do.</p>

<p>As I’ve already mentioned, I keep my commonplace book on Evernote. I make a note for the book, and fill the contents with the quotes/annotations and page numbers. This may seem tedious, but it’s not that bad. It serves two main functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You re-read and write down the points that most impacted you. This further cements these points in your memory.</li>
  <li>You create a summary of the best parts of the book. Anywhere you are, you can now access your annotation. If you’re writing a paper and want to quote a passage, look in your commonplace book.</li>
</ul>

<p>This method has really helped me get more value out of the books I read. We spend hours reading a book, only to forget much of it a few months later. By spending a few extra minutes up front, you distill the book into a personalized essence, which you can easily revisit later. I tend to include more details, like my thoughts on the book. Seeing these thoughts later triggers the recall of more nuanced details and the original joy of reading the book.</p>

<h2 id="advanced-method">Advanced Method</h2>

<p>Keep a book list in your commonplace book. In Evernote, I keep a table of the books I’ve read, when I read them, and I link the notes I took on them.</p>
