I'm keeping a running table of books I've read, a link to my notes on them (if any), and a recommendation.

__Recommendation Scale:__





| Book Title        | Author           | Posts |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
