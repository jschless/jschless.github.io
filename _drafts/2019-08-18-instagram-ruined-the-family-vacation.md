## The Holiday Card: A Harbinger for Instagram's Destruction

Circa 2008. As the holiday season approaches, my mom, along with my two sisters, would dust the cobwebs off of the family photo albums. The commitee would comb through these albums and select photos one-by-one until there was a field of candidates. Only one would emerge victorious to represent the family on the holiday card.

It sounds pleasant to reminisce over the past year by looking at photos, each representing a precious family memory. It wasn't. My mom would mediate as the two vain teenage girls fought tooth and nail to make the case for their photo (invariably the photo in which they looked the best).

This was a painful yearly process, but it was only once each year. Moreover, the concern over the photo was reasonable. Back in the days before mainstream social media, sharing pictures with a large audience was a rarity, if it happened at all. It was understandable for my sisters, two insecure teenagers, to be concerned with how they look in the one picture that family and friends will see of them for the entire year. 

## Facebook and the Profile Picture

The chaos of teenagers sharing their photos increased exponentially. It began when Facebook entered the mainstream among teenagers. Fundamental to your profile is the _profile picture_. The profile picture is your digital first impression. With such a high stakes photo, the holiday card photo selection plays out. Its different in a slight, but troubling way. 

When my sisters would fight, it was because they had different agendas. But, they each had a photo they liked that they preferred to share. When you're selecting a profile picture, there is no constraint. You have complete freedom of choice, which invites self-scrutiny and shame. Moreover, there are almost no barriers to taking a photo. You can take as many selfies and mirror pictures as you want until you get _the one,_ that special, like-maximizing picture of you, which is plausibly the first and only photo you took and not the best of an hour long photo shoot. It's a horrible thing for already-insecure teenagers to be scrutinized in this way, but I can again rationalize it with the infrequency of the pictures. Facebook cultural norms demand infrequent updating.

The stakes are also higher for a profile picture than a holiday card. As the profile picture is connected to everything you do on the site,

## The Fool's Errand of the Vacation Photo
Facebook was the spark to Instagram's conflagration. Instagram is much more popular among young people. (insert facts) 

The end result is the reframing of the photograph. Every photo is subject to the grueling holiday card photo selection process. Unfortunately, competition creates a positive feedback loop in which the next insta-worthy photo has to outdo the last.

I recently travelled to Lisbon, Portugal, a very popular tourist destination. Every place I went, there was ridiculousness. If a photo is about capturing life, I observed little photography. At the famous statue of King Jose, situated in a picturesque plaza with a waterfront view, a young woman was sitting on the ground sprawled out. A doting boyfriend was rapidly snapping photos of her with his $1,000 camera. If you removed the camera from the scene, it would have appeared to be an exorcism, but I suppose this is what constitutes glamour.

The point is a normal photo isn't good enough. Everyone takes a normal photo at the statue, and sure it's a beautiful scene, but it's been done before. It's not going to blow anyone's mind. Photos need to get bigger, more extravagant, more unique. This amateur photo shoot fizzled out after about five minutes, but the process is far from over.

Soon after the shoot, the arduous post-processing stage begins. The aspiring Instagram influencer runs a photo selection process similar to the holiday card one of ages ago. Post-processing can have one of three results:

1. All photos are rejected, but a reshoot is feasible. Reshoot as soon as possible.
2. There is a promising photo. Continue processing.
3. No photo is worthy and a reshoot is infeasible, which invalidates the vacation.

Once there is a promising photo, the influencer then edits it meticulously. They try different filters, consult friends, etc. After significant time and effort, the end result is a photo that is, again, indistinguishable from the original.

But it's not over. There's the caption. Who can be so bold as to omit a caption? The creative caption generation process then begins. How can you be witty? If not witty, how can you be profound? How do you seem sincere and authentic? How do you convince the world that you elected to stage an exorcism on the dirty floor of a public plaza because you're spunky and artistic and not because you're desparately seeking approval?

Once all is said and done, the post sits in the drafts section of Instagram. The influencer must now wait until a prime-posting hour to share. This is mostly superstitious, as they are unaware of the algorithm Instagram uses to construct its timeline and thereby order photos. Still, some times are better than others. There's something of a golden hour, depending on the level of the poster's insecurity. If prime-posting hour does not coincide with the golden hour, the user will likely grow uncertain of the quality of the post and simply discard it.

## Solutions
This has been a scathing criticism of modern photography, and I don't want to come off as _just_ a complainer. I have a few solutions in mind. 

1. __Stop__. Stop posting. Stop using the app. Live in the moment and take pictures because pictures are awesome. But a picture unshared is still good. Its not the approval of others that makes a picture worthy.

2. __Reduce followers__. Only let close friends and family follow you. Let the people who you would have shown your family picture books to. If your followers are a trusted community, it theoretically removes a lot of the pressure to post.

3. __Remove Likes__. It's rumored that Instagram will start phasing out the removal of visible likes. This may alleviate a lot of the pressure, as there is no metric of how good the picture is. You may post a really bad picture, and as far as others are concerned, it is as approved as any other picture.

, the bar for share-worthy photos was significantly lowered. Facebook was simply a translation from physical photo albums to the digital world. The plentitude of photos that comprised the typical photo album drove down the importance of any individual photo on the site. There was little pressure to have Facebook photos that were perfect. Except for one picture: the _profile picture_. 

The profile picture is the highest stakes picture on Facebook. It's connected to anything you do on the site. People see your name and that picture. It's a snapshot of how you generally want to represent yourself. Naturally, there is a lot of pressure on this one picture. 

Still, a profile picture only needs to be updated ever so often, according to Facebook norms. With the same rationalization process as the holiday card, we can again justify it as an occasional burden.


 
Instagram took the grueling holiday card photo selection process and turned it into a weekly process. 

The direction of the relationship is not straightforward. Was it that anything worth photographing is worth sharing on Instagram? Or is it that Instagram taught us that its only worth photogram if it could eventually, after sufficient editing, make it on the Gram?

On Instagram, anything worth taking a picture of
