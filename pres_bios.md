# Presidential Biographies
This page serves to document my progress on reading a biography of every President. I started this project to better acquaint myself with American history through the lens of its leaders.

I'm also maintaining this chart that evaluates the Presidents in certain categories. These rankings are subjective and made by someone with only a cursory understanding of the individuals, but when I'm done I think it will be interesting to compare different Presidents and analyze trends. 

| Name | Order Read | Ranking[^1] | Character[^2] | Privileged Upbringing [^3] | War Hero [^4]| Genetic Endowment [^5] | Familial Devotion [^6] |
| :----: | :----------: | :-------: | :---------: |  :---------------------: | :--------: | :-: | :--:
| [Harry S. Truman](/posts/Truman) | 1 | | 5 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 5|
| [George H. W. Bush](/posts/bush-41) | 2 | | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 
| Jimmy Carter | 3 | | 4 | 2 | 3  | 4 | 3 | 
 
[^1]: My subjective ranking, not according to historical impact or success of presidency. Strictly vibes.

[^2]: On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is scumbag and 5 is Mother Theresa, where does this President lie.

[^3]: On a scale of 1 to 5, a composite assessment of how privileged the upbringing was including both family life and wealth. 

[^4]: Roughly corresponds to a 5 point scale on how much of a war hero the person was. 1 is draft dodger, 2 is no military service because of peacetime, 3 is military service during wartime but didn't see much action, 4 is for combat experience, 5 is for valor and tremendous combat experiences or otherwise dramatic contribution to the war effort.

[^5]: On a scale of 1 to 5, how enviable the President's genes are or to what extent were they tall, handsome, smart, athletic, etc. 

[^6]: On a scale of 1 to 5, how devoted the President was to his family.
