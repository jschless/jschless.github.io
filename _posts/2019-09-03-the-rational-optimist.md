__TLDR__: _The Rational Optimist_ is a long, well-researched, and, at times, dry book that inspires hope for the future with statistics and a refreshing appreciative attitude. 

Interestingly enough, this book was recommended to me by General David Petraeus. I went to a talk and he told the audience to read it. That was nearly two years ago, but General Petraeus, I read it! It was worth it. The book is a bit dated (2010). It forced me to reflect on the history of mankind and the tremendous progress we have made. It made me hopeful that we will continue to make such progress. I agree with the central thesis of the book that trust (and the trade it enables) drives progress. 

### Rough Summary
- It is great to live today compared to the past. 
- Through trade, we have multiplied our knowledge, quality of live, and pretty much everything good. 
- Things will only get better with time. 
- Climate change is not as big a threat as people think.
- Africa is harmed by foreign aid.

It got a little too political at the end. Ridley starts ranting against environmental activism and likens it to a conspiracy, but I did not get a sense for why. I agree with many of the points (misrepresented statistics, exaggerated effects, poor science, hysteria, etc.) but to imply it is nefarious and not explain any underlying motive was strange.

There were a ton of interesting tidbits and facts. Ridley's best quality in my opinion is turning statistics into relatable measures, like his conversion of cost to time spent working.

- "Because it is a monopoly, government brings inefficiency and stagnation to most things it runs; government agencies pursue the inflation of their budgets rather than the service of their customers; pressure groups form an unholy alliance with agencies to extract more money from taxpayers for their members. Yet despite all this, most clever people still call for government to run more things and assume that if it did so, it would somehow be more perfect, more selfless, next time." 182

- "Give local people the power to own, exploit, and profit from natural resources in a sustainable way and they will usually preserve and cherish these resources.

That is the real lesson of the tragedy of the commons." 324
