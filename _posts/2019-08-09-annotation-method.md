What's the last book you read? What were the main points? You probably don't remember as much as you would like.

It's a reader's paradox: we enjoy books and feel like we're learning from them, yet a few weeks later we can't remember their basic details. This was in this week's [EconTalk](http://www.econtalk.org/andy-matuschak-on-books-and-learning/). I thought I'd share the solution I came up with awhile back.

I was frustrating with not remembering things, so I started annotating. I would underline, write comments, etc. This didn't work that well because I rarely revisited the books. I had the option to, but it wasn't convenient.

Then I saw this post from Ryan Holiday on keeping a [Commonplace Book](https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/). A commonplace book is simply a collection of thoughts, quotes, knowledge, etc. Anything that is interesting and may be useful later goes in it.

Ryan Holiday uses a collection of index cards organized into boxes, which is quaint and appeals to my luddite soul, but is incompatible with my toddler's handwriting. I use [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com), which is a phenomenal note-taking tool. It stores my notes on the cloud, I can access them from any device, and all my notes are searchable. It's also free for my purposes.

## Annotation Method

1. When you read, try to read with a pen. 
2. When you read something that interests you, you want to record, bracket the quote and perhaps respond briefly. 
3. Fold the corner of the bottom of the page in towards the annotation.
4. Continue reading. 
5. When you finish the book, catalog your annotations in your commonplace book.

It's pretty quick; All you do is re-read the section that you originally found interesting, which you'll likely be happy to do.

As I already mentioned, I keep my commonplace book on Evernote. I make a note for the book, and fill the contents with the quotes/annotations and page numbers. This may seem tedious, but its not that bad. It serves two main functions:
- You re-read and write down the points that most impacted you. This further cements these points in your memory.
- You create a summary of the best parts of the book. Anywhere you are, you can now access your annotation. If you're writing a paper and want to quote a passage, look in your commonplace book. 

This method has really helped me get more value out of the books I read. We spend hours reading a book, only to forget much of it a few months later. By spending a few extra minutes up front, you transform the book into something easily accessible and useful. I tend to include more details, like my thoughts on the book. Revisiting these later triggers the recall of more nuanced details. Also, these notes are searchable on Evernote!

## Advanced Method

Keep a book list in your commonplace book. In Evernote, I keep a table of the books I've read, when I read them, and I link the notes I took on them.
