What's the last book you read? If it was nonfiction, try to remember the main points. If it was fiction, try to remember more than an overview of the plot.

We paradoxically enjoy books and feel that they're changing our perspectives, yet a few weeks later we can't remember basic details from them. This phenomenon was well discussed in this week's [EconTalk](http://www.econtalk.org/andy-matuschak-on-books-and-learning/).

I ran into this problem early on in my reading career. I knew the key was annotation, but it is always such a pain to stop reading and record things, or to take notes. I developed the following technique. Much of it comes from Ryan Holiday and his article on keeping a [Commonplace Book](https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/). A commonplace book is a relic of the past. It's basically a central collection of thoughts, quotes, knowledge, etc. Anything can go in it; it just has to be something that is interesting and may be useful later.

While Ryan Holiday uses a collection of index cards, my handwriting is much too messy for that. I use [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com), which is a phenomenal note taking tool and very customizeable. 

1. When you read, try to read with a pen. 
2. When you read something that interests you, you want to record, bracket the quote and perhaps respond briefly. 
3. Fold the corner of the bottom of the page in towards the annotation.
4. Continue reading. 

It's pretty quick. It is a minimal distraction; all you have to do is re-read the section that you found interesting (not asking a lot).

5. When you finish the book, catalog your annotations. As I already mentioned, I do this in Evernote. I type the full quote and annotation and note which page it happened on. This may seem tedious, but its not that bad. It serves two main functions. First, you reread and write the points that most impacted you, which will further cement it in your memory. Second, you create a summary of the best parts of the book. Anywhere you are, you can access the annotations from the book. If you're writing a paper and want to quote a passage, look in your commonplace book. 

This method has really helped me get more value out of the books I read. We spend hours reading a book, only to forget much of it a few months later. By spending a few extra minutes, you finish the book and have more than just memories.
