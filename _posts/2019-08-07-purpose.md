I'm starting a blog, and there are many reasons to scratch your head. What does a 20-something-year-old have to say? Who cares? Who will read it? And on and on. This is more than some millenial rite-of-passage, but not by much. Here are my reasons:

1. I'm bored. This seems like a productive way to occupy my time.

2. I have a few things to share. I have no audience, but I always have my mom. This is a digital variant of the kitchen refrigerator, and my posts are a slightly more advanced crayon drawing.

3. I anticipate having more things to share. I write this at the onset of my Master's Program, where I'll be studying both technology policy and some applied math / econ. I will be writing a lot, and can use this site to share and catalog my work. This will likely include op-eds, policy recommendations/analyses, and mathy/codey things.

4. Having this burden will motivate me to write, which is something I enjoy and need to practice.

5. I can share my books I've read and what I've learned.

6. This is a working resume. 

So let it be known, before I'm swallowed by my own ego, that this quest had humble beginnings.
