I'm starting this website for a few reasons.

1. I'm bored. Who knows how long this will last, but in the interim, this should suffice.

2. I have a few things to share. I have no audience, but I at least have my mom. 

3. I anticipate having more things to share. I write this at the onset of two years of studying at MIT. I'll be studying Technology and Policy, with some applied math. I will be writing a lot, and can use this site to share my work. This will likely include op-eds, policy recommendations/analyses, and mathy/codey things.

4. Having this burden will motivate me to write, which is something I enjoy and need to practice.

5. I can share my books I've read and what I've learned.

6. A working resume. 

So let it be known, before I'm swallowed by my own ego, that this quest had humble beginnings.
